# Obsidian config

> Obsidian config I use for my vaults

## Usage

- Copy the `.obsidian` to your vault, adapt configs as needed and have fun.
- If you want to use vim, you can also copy my `./.obsidian.vimrc`

## Features

1. Vim mode and config
2. Mind map and table editor support
3. Custom keybindings and config
4. And much more

## Notes

If you want to use Markdown links instead of Wikilinks, use the following config in `./.obsidian/app.json`:

```json
  "newLinkFormat": "relative",
  "useMarkdownLinks": true
```

With this setting, links and images work when previewing and rendering the markdown sites to HTML, PDF & co.

## Licence

You can use the config. For the code in the `./obsidian/plugins/` directory check the LICENCE of the Plugin directly.
